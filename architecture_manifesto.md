- Use verb phrases for action interfaces (e.g., `ContentProcessor`, `MediaGenerator`)
- Suffix implementation classes with their strategy (e.g., `RedditContentSource`, `GPTScriptGenerator`)
- Keep names consistent across related interfaces

### 4.4 Method Design Guidelines

- Methods should have clear, single purposes
