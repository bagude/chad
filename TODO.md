### Technical Guidelines

1. Quality First:

   - Comprehensive testing
   - Performance metrics
   - Security by design
   - Resource efficiency

2. Implementation Patterns:

   - Clean architecture
   - Dependency injection
   - Factory patterns
   - Builder patterns

3. Operational Excellence:
   - Monitoring hooks
   - Health checks
   - Resource management
   - Error recovery

### Notes

Priority order based on MVP needs:

1. Core services - enables basic operations
2. Quality framework - ensures reliability
3. Plugin system - enables extensibility
4. Monitoring - ensures maintainability
